# Fashion-Product-Recommadation-project
In this project, I developed a fashion product recommendation system that utilizes image analysis to suggest relevant fashion items to users based on their preferences and style. The goal was to enhance the shopping experience for users and increase sales for the e-commerce platform.

Key Steps:
1. Data Collection: Gathered a diverse dataset of fashion product images from the e-commerce platform.
2. Image Analysis: Utilized deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract
meaningful features from the product images.
3. User Preference Modeling: Implemented collaborative filtering or content-based filtering algorithms to model user
preferences and behavior based on their interactions and product selections.
4. Recommendation Engine: Combined the image analysis results with user preference models to build a powerful
recommendation engine capable of suggesting fashion items based on both image similarities.
5. User Interface: Developed a user-friendly interface where customers can explore personalized fashion
recommendations based on their preferences and style.
